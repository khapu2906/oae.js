**# Project Structure Explanation

This document provides a brief overview of the project's file and directory structure.

## Top-Level Directories

-   `dist`: This directory typically contains the production-ready build output of the project. Files in this directory are usually the result of a build process (e.g., using Webpack).
-   `engine`: This directory seems to contain core engine logic, possibly related to rendering or routing.
    -   `constants.js`:  Likely defines constant values used throughout the engine.
    -   `render.js`: Probably handles the rendering logic of the application.
    -   `router.js`: Likely manages the routing and navigation within the application.
-   `node_modules`: This directory houses all the installed npm packages (dependencies) for the project. It's automatically generated when you run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
-   `src`: This directory usually contains the main source code of the application.
    -   `layouts`: Contains layout templates, probably using EJS.
        -   `index.ejs`:  An EJS template for the main layout.
        -   `minimal.ejs`: An EJS template for a minimal layout.
    -   `pages`:  Contains different pages of the application.
        -   `about`:  Directory for the "About" page.
        -   `bye`:  Directory for the "Bye" page.
            -   `index.ejs`: EJS template for the "Bye" page.
            -   `index.ts`: TypeScript file, likely containing the logic for the "Bye" page.
        -   `hello`: Directory for the "Hello" page.
    -   `styles`: Contains styling-related files (e.g., CSS, Sass).
        -   `global.d.ts`: TypeScript declaration file for global styles.
        -   `index.ejs`: EJS template related to styles.
        -   `main.ts`: Main TypeScript file, the entry point of the application.
        -   `provider.ts`:  Likely a TypeScript file providing some context or data to the application.

## Configuration Files

-   `package.json`: This file contains metadata about the project, including dependencies, scripts, and other configuration information.
-   `tsconfig.json`:  Configuration file for the TypeScript compiler. It specifies how TypeScript code should be compiled into JavaScript.
-   `tsconfig.webpack.json`: TypeScript configuration specifically for Webpack.
-   `webpack.config.js`:  Configuration file for Webpack, a module bundler. It defines how the project's assets are bundled and processed.
-   `yarn.lock`: This file ensures that the exact same versions of dependencies are installed across different environments.  It's used with Yarn, another package manager.
